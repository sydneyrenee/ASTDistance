# AST Distance

Cross-language AST similarity measurement and porting analysis tool.

Inspired by the [ASTERIA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06082) which uses Tree-LSTM for binary code similarity detection, this tool measures similarity between Rust and Kotlin source files to help verify porting accuracy.

## Features

- **Tree-sitter parsing** for Rust, Kotlin, and C++ ASTs
- **Normalized node types** that map across languages
- **Multiple similarity metrics**:
  - Cosine similarity of node type histograms
  - Structure similarity (size, depth)
  - Jaccard similarity of node sets
  - Normalized tree edit distance
- **Codebase-level analysis**:
  - Dependency graph building
  - File matching by port-lint headers or name similarity
  - Porting priority ranking
  - Detailed function/type symbol parity in default reports
  - Documentation gap detection
- **Quality checks**:
  - TODO scanning with context
  - Lint error detection
  - Stub file identification

## Building

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

### Compare two files
```bash
./ast_distance <file1> <lang1> <file2> <lang2>
```

### Full codebase analysis
```bash
./ast_distance --deep <src_dir> <src_lang> <tgt_dir> <tgt_lang>
```

Default codebase reports are intentionally detailed: terminal output and generated
markdown reports include per-file function parity, type parity, and the complete
missing-symbol names needed for porting work.

See [TRANSLITERATION_DISTANCE.md](TRANSLITERATION_DISTANCE.md) for the planned
parser-guided translated-buffer distance model.

Optional `ast_distance.config.json` files can define `reexport_modules` patterns
for declarations-only wiring files that should be reported as consult-only
instead of prioritized as direct logic ports:

```json
{
  "reexport_modules": ["values/layout/heap.rs", "*/mod.rs"]
}
```

### Show missing files
```bash
./ast_distance --missing <src_dir> <src_lang> <tgt_dir> <tgt_lang>
```

### Scan for TODOs
```bash
./ast_distance --todos <directory>
```

### Run lint checks
```bash
./ast_distance --lint <directory>
```

## Port-Lint Headers

Add a header comment to each ported file to enable accurate source tracking:

```kotlin
// port-lint: source core/src/config.rs
package com.example.config

data class Config(...)
```

The header must appear in the first 50 lines. When present, the tool will:
- Match files explicitly instead of by name similarity
- Compare documentation coverage between source and target
- Report "Matched by header" vs "Matched by name" statistics

## Example Output

### File Comparison
```
=== AST Similarity Report ===
Tree 1: size=148, depth=8
Tree 2: size=162, depth=10

Similarity Metrics:
  Cosine (histogram):    0.9836
  Structure:             0.8568
  Combined Score:        0.7737

=== Documentation Comparison ===
Doc comment count: 2 vs 2 (diff: 0)
Doc lines:         4 vs 2 (diff: 2)
Doc text cosine:   100.00%
```

### Deep Analysis
```
=== Porting Quality Summary ===

Matched by header:    103 / 107
Matched by name:      4 / 107
Total TODOs in target: 56
Total lint errors:    356

=== Porting Recommendations ===

Top priority to create:
  core.error                     deps=51
  render.renderable              deps=19
  state.session                  deps=18
```
